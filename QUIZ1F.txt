During the troubleshooting process, the charger we used wasn't compatible with the raspberry pi B since the model B uses between 1000 mA depending on what peripherals are connected. on our final troubleshoot we connect to the right and compatible charger and fortunately it is functional and still working. Therefore, before you proceed to a more complicated diagnostics try to check whether your power outlet is properly working or the supply/charger used is compatible to your raspberry pi model.
